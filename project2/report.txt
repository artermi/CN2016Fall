what I do:
(1)	read the file:
	Use fstream to read the file.
	After read in the file, parse the file with the tag linearly
	(e.g. read a <ID>, store the words until meet the </ID>)
(2)	create connection:
	use socket connection, and the detail is trivial.
(3)	send message:
	the control codes go as follow:

	(a) character or string:
	    very simple, write the char/string in to the socket directly.

	(b) "/n" and enter:
	    send "/r".

	(c) crtl_p,crtl_x:
	    write 16 and 24.

	(d) right,left:
	    write {0x1b,0x5b,0x44} and {0x1b,0x5b,0x43} respectively.
Bonus:
(1) I can send chinese.
(2) Type "./project2 DOLLAR" to the command line, can switch to P_dollar mode.
    In this mode, it send one character in content per half second.
    According to ptt's rule, every character earn 0.25P, and in every 2 sec,
    user can get 1 P dollar at most.
    Thus, P_dollar mode can send character in the rate of 1/0.5 char/sec. And
    when send more than 4000 character, it send all the others word together.
    it help the user get the most P dollar in the fastest speed.
